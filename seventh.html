            “Once upon a time a Tortoise and a Rabbit had an argument about who was faster....................<br>

They decided to settle the argument with a race. They agreed on a route and started off the race. The rabbit shot ahead and ran briskly for some time. Then seeing that he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he'd sit under a tree for some time and relax before continuing the race. He sat under the tree and soon fell asleep. The tortoise plodding on overtook him and 

soon finished the race, emerging as the undisputed champ. The rabbit woke up and realized that he'd lost the race.”

<strong><span style="color:blueviolet"> moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race.</strong> This is the version of the story that we've all grown up with. 

<b>But then recently, <span style="color:brown"> story still continues:</b>

rabbit was disappointed at losing the race and he did some soul-searching. He realized that he'd lost the race only because he had been overconfident, careless and lax. If he had not taken things for granted, there's no way the tortoise could have beaten him. So he challenged the tortoise to another race. The tortoise agreed. This time, the rabbit went all out and ran without stopping from start to finish. He won by several miles.
